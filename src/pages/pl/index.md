        **Central European Petroleum Ltd.** expanded its exploration activities
        into Poland by participating in the first hydrocarbon concessions
        licensing round in 2016 after successfully completing the
        pre-qualification procedure. Following the competitive process which
        follows the European Union Directive 94/22, CEP was awarded the Wolin
        Concession in northwest Poland in December 2017. The Onshore/ Offshore
        License is flanked by, and on trend with, two conventional gas-bearing
        reservoirs where 6 successful wells have been drilled to date.
