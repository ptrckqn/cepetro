    ## CEP is currently exploring the hydrocarbon potential along the Baltic Sea
    in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and along the German-Polish border in Brandenburg
    (Germany).


    > Following the initial grant in 2007, CEP held eight exploration licenses
    at peak activity covering about 1.5 million acres in the states of
    Mecklenburg Vorpommern and Brandenburg. Field operations commenced in 2009
    with acquisition of 3D seismic and the first exploration well was drilled in
    2011. CEP made a gas condensate discovery in 2016 and was later awarded the
    Guhlen Production License in September 2017. Activities are currently
    focused on appraising the discovery


    More information on the licence areas of CEP ("Erlaubnisfelder") and the
    companyâ€™s exploration activities ("Bohrung/Seismik") can be found
