  ## CEP is currently exploring the potential of oil deposits in licenced areas
  along the Baltic Sea in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and along the
  German-Polish border in Brandenburg (Germany).


  > Since the commencement of operations in Germany in 2008, CEP has been
  granted eight licences to explore the feasibility of producing oil in areas
  covering about 1.5 million acres along the Baltic Sea in Mecklenburg-Western
  Pomerania and on the German-Polish border in Brandenburg. Should these
  exploratory activities yield positive results, CEP intends to seek permission
  to start the production of oil and intensify its search for further deposits
  in the north-east of Germany.   


  The presence of oil and gas deposits in the areas explored by CEP in
  Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and Brandenburg is well documented. They were
  first explored and developed by the former state-owned production company
  Erdöl-Erdgas Gommern (EEG) in former East Germany – long before modern
  technology and innovative techniques were available. However, despite the
  existing knowledge, the areas currently explored by CEP feature a number of
  large and small anomalies that require further investigation.  


  To this end, CEP builds on the know-how of the former EEG and combines it with
  modern, state-of-the-art techniques to map new structures and to determine the
  existence of reservoirs and develop new oil fields.  


  More information on the licence areas of CEP ("Erlaubnisfelder") and the
  company’s exploration activities ("Bohrung/Seismik") can be found
