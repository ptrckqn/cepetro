        ## CEP is currently exploring the hydrocarbon potential along the Baltic
        Sea in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and along the German-Polish border in
        Brandenburg (Germany).


        > Following the initial grant in 2007, CEP held eight exploration
        licenses at peak activity covering about 1.5 million acres in the states
        of Mecklenburg Vorpommern and Brandenburg. Field operations commenced in
        2009 with acquisition of 3D seismic and the first exploration well was
        drilled in 2011. CEP made a gas condensate discovery in 2016 and was
        later awarded the Guhlen Production License in September 2017.
        Activities are currently focused on appraising the discovery

        ## CEP is currently exploring the hydrocarbon potential along the Baltic
        coast of Northwestern Poland.


        > Following the award of the Wolin Onshore/ Offshore License in
        Northwestern Poland CEP has successfully completed 2 seismic programs;
        an onshore 2D seismic program in late 2018 and in early June of 2019, an
        OBN based 3D seismic survey which is the first of its kind to be
        conducted in Poland.
