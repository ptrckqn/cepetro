    Since the commencement of operations in Germany in 2008, CEP has been granted eight licences to explore the feasibility of producing oil in areas covering about 1.5 million acres along the Baltic Sea in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and on the German-Polish border in Brandenburg. Should these exploratory activities yield positive results, CEP intends to seek permission to start the production of oil and intensify its search for further deposits in the north-east of Germany.
