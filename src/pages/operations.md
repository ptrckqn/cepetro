    ## CEP is currently exploring the potential of oil deposits in licenced areas
    along the Baltic Sea in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and along the
    German-Polish border in Brandenburg (Germany).


    > Following the initial grant in 2007, CEP held eight exploration licenses at
    peak activity covering about 1.5 million acres in the states of Mecklenburg
    Vorpommern and Brandenburg. Field operations commenced in 2009 with
    acquisition of 3D seismic and the first exploration well was drilled in 2011.
    CEP made a gas condensate discovery in 2016 and was later awarded the Guhlen
    Production License in September 2017. Activities are currently focused on
    appraising the discovery


    More information on the licence areas of CEP ("Erlaubnisfelder") and the
    companyâ€™s exploration activities ("Bohrung/Seismik") can be found

  ops: "CEP expanded its exploration activities into neighboring Poland by participating in the first hydrocarbon concessions licensing round in 2016 after successfully completing the pre-qualification procedure. Following the competitive process which follows the European Union Directive 94/22, CEP was awarded the Wolin Concession in northwest Poland in December 2017. The Onshore/ Offshore License is flanked by, and on trend with, two conventional gas-bearing reservoirs where 6 successful wells have been drilled to date.\r\n\n\rCEP has successfully completed an onshore 2D seismic program in late 2018 and in early June of 2019, completed an OBN based 3D seismic survey which is the first of its kind to be conducted in Poland. More information about our activities in Poland can be found here\n\nMore in formation can be found [here](https://focused-payne-ffde0a.netlify.com/pl)"
