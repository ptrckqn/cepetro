\    <h2>Central European Petroleum (CEP) Completes Drilling of Wolin East 1 (WE 1) on the Wolin Concession</h2>

\    

\    <p><strong>Warsaw, February 20th 2025</strong></p>

\    

\    <p>Central European Petroleum (CEP) has completed drilling the first well, <strong>Wolin East 1 (WE 1)</strong>, on the Wolin concession. The data obtained during drilling is now undergoing detailed analysis with the initial results looking promising. The well is now suspended for future use and the specialized drilling rig, the <strong>Noble Resolve</strong>, which conducted the drilling operation, will move to <strong>Frederikshavn, Denmark</strong>.</p>

\    

\    <p>The <strong>Wolin concession</strong> covers an area of <strong>593 km²</strong> and was issued by the <strong>Ministry of Climate and Environment</strong>. CEP aims to explore for hydrocarbons in the <strong>Ca2 main Dolomite</strong> and the <strong>Rotliegend reservoirs</strong>. In the <strong>WE1</strong> well, CEP carried out <strong>drilling, coring, logging and downhole testing operations</strong> in the <strong>Ca2 main Dolomite reservoir</strong>.</p>

\    

\    <p>Pre-drilling data suggested that the <strong>main dolomite Ca2 reservoir</strong> could contain up to:</p>

\    

\    <ul>

\    <li><strong>16.5 BCM</strong> of recoverable gas</li>

\    <li><strong>10.3 million cubic meters</strong> of recoverable liquids</li>

\    </ul>

\    

\    <p>These pre-drill resource estimates will be updated based on the data gathered in <strong>WE1 well</strong>, with the results expected in <strong>2-3 months</strong>.</p>

\    

\    <p>The right granted to <strong>Central European Petroleum</strong> to explore, assess, and extract hydrocarbons in the <strong>Wolin license</strong> presents a unique opportunity in the <strong>Baltic Sea area</strong>, where very few wells have been drilled previously.</p>

\    

\    <blockquote>

\    "Thanks to our extensive experience with similar wells across Europe, the entire WE1 drilling operation was completed as planned. We will now undertake a thorough analysis of all the data obtained during drilling, which will take few months,"  

\    <br>— <strong>Rolf G. Skaar, CEO of Central European Petroleum</strong>

\    </blockquote>

\

\    <p><strong>Central European Petroleum Ltd is a Canadian exploration and production company headquartered in Calgary, with the majority ownership held by Norwegian investors. Its subsidiary, CEP Central European Petroleum Sp. z o. o., holds the Wolin concession and serves as the operator of the concession in northwestern Poland</strong>.</p>
