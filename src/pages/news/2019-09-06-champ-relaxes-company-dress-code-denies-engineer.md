One day after winning the Glencoe G&CC club championship company CFO, Robyn Hemminger (Champ), has already begun to implement his winning strategies at the office.  Monday morning The Champ sent out a company memo stating that golf attire would be included in the company dress code.

> "Polo's, wind and water resistant shells, visors and hats, golf athletic pants and golf gloves should be featured in all employee wardrobes" the memo read.  However, much to the engineers dismay Mr. Hemminger stated "I draw the line at cargo's though, and hikers..  That's public course crap and they'll be non of it in the work place.

The Champ was non-committal when it came to concert and ironic tee shirts.  While not a huge fan of that 'hipster garbage' the beloved Tee's were not outright banned.
