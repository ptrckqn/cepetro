The Regional Directorate for Environmental Protection in Szczecin (Regionalna Dyrekcja Ochrony Środowiska w Szczecinie, “RDOŚ”) has granted CEP an affirmative Environmental Decision for acquisition of onshore and offshore seismic in the company’s Wolin Concession.
 
The Wolin Concession was awarded to CEP by the Ministry of Environment (“MoE”) in December 2017 with the condition that an Environmental Decision be obtained from RDOŚ prior to commencing field operations. Accordingly, a Karta Informacyjna Przedsięwzięć (Project Information Card) detailing the planned 2D and 3D seismic acquisition program was filed at RDOŚ on February 23rd, 2018. Following several months of evaluation and consultation with impacted stakeholders, RDOŚ issued its Environmental Decision on July 31st, 2018.
 
CEP’s updated Projekt Robót Geologicznych (geological work program, “PRG”), which includes the details of the planned seismic acquisition operations and the conditions of the Environmental Decision, has been filed with the MoE and the company will commence seismic acquisition operations once the MoE has reviewed and approved the update.
