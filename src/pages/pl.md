CEP expanded its exploration activities into Poland by participating in the first hydrocarbon concessions licensing round in 2016 after successfully completing the pre-qualification procedure. Following the competitive process which follows the European Union Directive 94/22, CEP was awarded the Wolin Concession in northwest Poland in December 2017. The Onshore/ Offshore License is flanked by, and on trend with, two conventional gas-bearing reservoirs where 6 successful wells have been drilled to date.
